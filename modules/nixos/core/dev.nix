# itera's developer-tooling battery.
#
# A freshly installed itera system ships nothing to work on a Nix configuration
# with — notably no `git`, so you can't clone, edit, and commit your own flake
# (or itera itself) out of the box. Every other package itera installs is scoped
# to the battery that needs it; the dev-shell tools (nil, nixfmt, …) live only in
# `nix develop` and never land on an installed host. This battery closes that gap
# with a small, curated set of system-wide tooling.
#
# Deliberately lean: the default is `git` (the one thing you cannot bootstrap a
# config workflow without), the GitHub CLI `gh` (open/manage PRs against your
# flake without leaving the shell), and `nodejs`. `packages` is the extension
# point — append your own editors/CLIs, or drop the battery entirely and install
# per-user via `itera.users.<name>.packages`.
#
# `nodejs` is in that set as a runtime, not as dev-preference tooling. The agentic
# CLIs itera ships — `itera.ai.claude`, and the ACP adapter the editor battery
# registers with Zed — load plugins whose hooks are plain Node scripts invoked as
# bare `node`. nixpkgs' `claude-code` is now a self-contained native binary that
# carries no nodejs in its closure and does not put one on PATH, so without this
# entry every such hook fails with `node: command not found` and the plugin
# silently does nothing. Nothing else in itera provides a system-wide node.
#
# Opt-OUT (default ON with `itera.enable`), following the core-battery shape.
